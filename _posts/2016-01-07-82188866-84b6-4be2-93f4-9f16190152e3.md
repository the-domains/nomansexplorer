No Man's Sky... Lift off t-minus 6 Months.

Easily one of the most anticipated titles of the year. This space simulator sees you travel to Hundred of thousands of procedurally generated planets. Stunning looks, spaceship and planet customisation, and intergalactic resource trading makes this a sci-fi fan's paradise. 

No Man's Explorer wants to join forces with everyone to let the world experience the 5 billion years of game play before we die. null
